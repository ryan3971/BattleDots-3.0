# BattleDots-Multiplayer

Almost identical to BattleDots-2.0, except not quite as up-to-date, and with the added feature of playing against another person via Bluetooth. 
This game is still in development. 
It is not available on the Google Play Store.

Note: this version of the game will crash if you are not connected to another player.
